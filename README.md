# Tron
This game is based on the video game Tron.  It can be played with two players against each other or single player against the computer.  The computer difficulty can be changed, as well as the colour for each player and the speed of movement.

## Instructions
To set up: First, I made this in Eclipse and I do not know how well it will work in other IDEs.  You can download Eclipse at http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

The MediaPlayer requires you to specify the file path for the background sounds.  This can be done by right clicking on "Popcorn Original Song.wav" and "Scream.wav" in the Resources folder, and copying the location.  The program should work without the sound, but it is more enjoyable with it and will print an error statement if you don't set the file path.

The instructions for each player are saved as an image in the Resources folder, and appear when you run the program.  Single player uses the arrow keys, and two player adds WASD for the second player.

## Additional Information
This was my first semi-decent game I made.  It was my first experience with MouseListener, KeyListener, and Graphics.
The controls are very simple and the "AI" works decently, but it is not perfect and any suggestions are appreciated!
